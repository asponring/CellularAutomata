CellularAutomata
================

This was a class project. Using java, I created an elementary cellular automaton generator.

Simply open CellularAutomata.java. The console will prompt you to give a rule number. The corresponding pattern will be printed to the console. 

Concepts used in this project:
1. Getting user input from console
2. Do/while loop
3. For loop
4. Java classes & constructors
5. Converting integers to binary strings
